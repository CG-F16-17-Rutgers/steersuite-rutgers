PART B
$ ./steersim -testcase ../../testcases/polygons2.xml -ai collisionAI

Creating spatialdatabase: gridDatabase
Creating planning domain: gridDomain
Created a grid database planning domain *************
checking: ./collisionAI.dll for module
loaded module collisionAI
loaded module testCasePlayer

(WINDOWS SAYS THE PROGRAM HAS CRASHED AT THIS POINT AND THE TERMINAL OUTPUT DOES NOT HAVE ANYTHING ELSE)


PART C
[this needs to be replaced with an explanation of the differences. Will do tomorrow morning]

The fixed version is called polygons_2.xml

Its' terminal output is

$ ./steersim -testcase ../../testcases/polygons_2.xml -ai collisionAI

Creating spatialdatabase: gridDatabase

PART D

[this needs a description of the implementation and also what happened before the code was changed)

It runs successfully and detects no collisions as can be seen in the following terminal output

$ ./steersim -testcase ../../testcases/polygons3.xml -ai collisionAI
